# Notes

The CSS styles are created for educational purposes for the video tutorial. These styles are optimized to minimize the amount of HTML code used, which allows for a simpler and clearer explanation in the tutorial. As a result, some of these styles may introduce unnecessary complexity for real-world projects. This approach helps reduce the number of lines in the HTML templates to make the explanation easier to follow and the visualization simpler.
