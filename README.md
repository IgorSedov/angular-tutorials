Code examples from my Angular video tutorials on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@theigorsedov).

This repository contains only the files created or modified in the tutorials. To run an example, place these files in a new Angular project, replacing the corresponding files as needed.

The media files (e.g., images, icons) included in this repository are placeholders used for demonstration purposes. These placeholders represent the visual layout and structure but are not the actual media used in the video tutorials. The placeholder files are stored in the `public/` directory and are referenced in the HTML or CSS code.
